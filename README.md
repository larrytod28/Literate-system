# Zanti_Misfit
> “They laughed at the warning systems… until I rewired them with kindness.”

Welcome to the back alley of the digital frontier.

I’m **Zanti_Misfit** – white hat, chaos whisperer, and poetic debugger of broken systems. Born from the VHS-static of East Boston and forged in the pixel-fires of TryHackMe and Coursera, I’m building tools, writing up exploits, and keeping it righteous.

This GitHub is my locker, my notebook, and my low-orbit satellite dish. Expect:

- **Cybersecurity Tools & Scripts** – built by hand, broken down, commented for the people.
- **TryHackMe Write-ups** – walkthroughs that don’t just solve, they *teach*.
- **Wireshark & Nmap Filters** – like decoder rings for network noise.
- **Zines & Visual Docs** – printable PDFs for hackers who still love paper.
- **Poetic Code Experiments** – because even Bash has a beat if you listen.

I’m not here to "move fast and break things." I move **intentionally** and fix what never should’ve been broken.

If you're a misfit too—stay tuned, fork something, or drop me a repo request from the void.
